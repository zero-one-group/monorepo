The Zero One Group Monorepo is a unified foundation designed to accelerate the development of modern web and backend applications. It provides a structured, scalable, and opinionated environment for building software using **TypeScript**, **Go**, and **Python**.

Powered by [moonrepo](https://moonrepo.dev), this monorepo streamlines workspace management, task orchestration, and build caching, ensuring that teams can collaborate efficiently and deliver high-quality software with speed.

## Motivation

Building software across multiple repositories often leads to inconsistent tooling, duplicated efforts, and fragmented best practices. We created this monorepo to solve these challenges by providing:

- **Ready-to-use Templates**: Curated starting points for various application types, from React frontends to Go microservices.
- **Consistent Tooling**: Standardized configurations for linting, formatting, testing, and building across all projects.
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Reusable libraries and UI components to reduce boilerplate and ensure visual consistency.
- **Scalable Architecture**: A well-defined project structure that supports growth without becoming unmanageable.

## Key Features

- **Polyglot Support**: First-class support for TypeScript (Frontend/Backend), Go (Backend), and Python (AI/Data).
- **Efficient Builds**: Intelligent caching and task execution with moonrepo to minimize build times.
- **Standardized Workflows**: Pre-configured CI/CD pipelines and local development scripts.
- **Developer Experience**: Integrated tools for enhanced productivity, including scaffold generators and automated dependency management.

Whether you are starting a new project or contributing to an existing one, this documentation will guide you through the essentials of working within the Zero One Group Monorepo.
